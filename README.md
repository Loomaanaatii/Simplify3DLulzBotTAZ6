# Simplify3DLulzBotTAZ6
Simplify3D Profiles for LulzBot TAZ6

After searching around, most of the Simplify3D settings for the LulzBot TAZ 6 would not work.
I have taken the time to modify the Simplify3D settings to get it to work.

So far, I have tested: 
- Verbatim PLA

I will be testing:
- MG Chemicals PLA
- MG Chemicals ABS
- LulzBot ABS

As soon as I have completed the test I will upload them here.
